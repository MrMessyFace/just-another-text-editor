# Just Another Text Editor

## Description

We were tasked with building a in browser text editor that still works when you have low or no internet connection.

## Installation

I used Express, Nodemon, Concurrently, Babel, Webpack, and IDB.

## Usage

You can edit text in the browser but you can also press the Install button and it will allow you to install it to your desktop.
